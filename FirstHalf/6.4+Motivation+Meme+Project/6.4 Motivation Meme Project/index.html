  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <p> When I finally found you Si Si. Moaaaaa˚ʚ♡ɞ˚Now please scroll down Si Si.</p>

    <p class="second">Okay now is the main part. I know that this is a little rough time for us. Thank you for letting me know
      your feelings, I really appreciate when you talk to me about your feelings even though it is tough to confess all the thoughts like that. I love it when you trust me and want to share many things
      with me. I had done many things that cut you deeply and hurt your feelings, bae. I'm really really sorry.
      Despite all of that you still love me and care for me. I will try to be more caring and put myself more in your point of view in the things
      I do. If you find something I do hard to accept, just tell me okay? I believe with communication, our
      relationship can last long and go through all the hard times. I will try to be with you, walk with you in this 
      life, and always be there for you. I love you bae and thank you for being in my life. Moaa.

    <h2> This is some moments i really love of us.</h2>
